Live chat support agents understand this very well. But if you are forced to ask the same questions again and again ‚Äî May I please have your registered email address?, how can I help you today? let me transfer your chat to the relevant team. ‚Äî the inefficiency increases for everyone.</p><p>The good news: you can avoid these questions by collecting information about your customers as soon as they enter your live chat window, with the help of our pre-chat forms. You can also set up specific rules to determine who to assign these conversations to, what labels to add, or what else to do with such conversations. This creates a suitable workflow for your team, sparing them a lot of time.</p><p>Here‚Äôs how it works. ‚¨áÔ∏è</p><h2 id=\"step-i-collect-user-info-with-pre-chat-forms\">Step I.

You can set up multiple rules to delight your users as well as save your team‚Äôs time.</p><p>Let‚Äôs say you run an e-commerce store. You can enable a pre-chat form for your live chat widget with fields like:</p><ul><li>Name [<em>text type</em>]</li><li>Email ID [<em>email type</em>]</li><li>Type of issue [<em>list to choose from: tracking, payment, cancellation, etc</em>]</li><li>Issue description [<em>message]</em></li></ul><p>To club with, you can make an Automation Rule. So, whenever a conversation is created <em>plus</em> a message containing ‚Äúpayment‚Äù is incoming, it would be assigned to the finance team and a label saying ‚Äúpayment_issue‚Äù would be added. You can add another rule that would trigger a message saying ‚ÄúSomeone will be with you shortly.‚Äù</p><p>So, whenever agents open the chat, they‚Äôll have all the relevant information at their fingertips.</p><p>How are you going to use the Automations?
