To disallow impersonation and to keep the conversation with your customers private, we recommend setting up the identity validation in Chatwoot. Identity validation is enabled by generating an HMAC(hash based message authentication code) based on the identifier attribute, using SHA256. Along with the identifier you can pass identifier_hash also as shown below to make sure that the user is correct one.</p><p>Read more about it <a href=\"https://www.chatwoot.com/docs/website-sdk/identity-validation\">here</a></p><h3 id=\"ability-to-manage-your-support-email-inbox-threaded-replies\">Ability to manage your Support Email Inbox (threaded replies)</h3><p>Support emails can be viewed in Chatwoot now.
